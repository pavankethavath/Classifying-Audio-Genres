## üåü Overview

This project demonstrates the application of data science to solve real-world problems in the music industry. By preprocessing, clustering, and analyzing song data, the system provides recommendations for users based on the similarity of features like danceability, energy, and tempo. 

---

## üåü **Project Highlights**

- **Real Data**: The dataset includes detailed song-level attributes sourced from Spotify, providing insights into audio characteristics.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Implements **KMeans Clustering** for grouping similar songs.
- **Similarity-Based Recommendations**: Uses **cosine similarity** to recommend songs closest to user preferences.
- **Interactive Interface**: A clean and user-friendly **Streamlit** web application for seamless user interaction.
- **Data Visualization**: Insightful visualizations showcasing clustering, feature correlations, and distributions.

## üöÄ **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - The dataset contains song features like `danceability`, `energy`, `tempo`, and more.
   - Metadata such as song names, artists, popularity, and release year are included for richer insights.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Standardized numerical features to ensure uniformity using **StandardScaler**.
   - Dimensionality reduction using **PCA** for noise reduction and computational efficiency.

3. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - **KMeans Clustering** groups songs with similar attributes.
   - Optimal clusters are determined using the **Elbow Method**.

4. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - **Cosine Similarity** measures the closeness of songs within a cluster.
   - Recommendations are ranked by similarity score.

5. **Interactive User Interface**:
   - Built with **Streamlit** for a dynamic and easy-to-use app.
   - Users input a song name to get recommendations based on dataset attributes.

# üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

### **Clustering Visualization (PCA)**:
Clusters are visualized using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, showing clear separations among song groups. Here's an example of the clustering output:

### **Clustering Visualization (t-SNE)**:
To further understand cluster separations, we used **t-SNE** for high-dimensional data visualization:
